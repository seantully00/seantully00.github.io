    <h1>Autumn in Tarrytown</h1>
    <h3>I heard a gong like an abrupt alarm,<br>
an awakening, and there I was,<br>
zipping across Main Street, aware<br>
of the too cold air, of the death of leaves,<br>
and of the charm on her ankle.<br>
She was crossing ahead<br>
of me, and that cheap copper chain<br>
jangled like a teacup on a saucer,<br>
like a reindeer's bell, like glass shattering,<br>
like anything loud and everything fragile.<br>
The firehouse's horn went off and she jumped,<br>
and I jumped, and we both hopped the curb<br>
to the sidewalk. I stopped and felt the hairs<br>
on my arms (they tingled at their roots),<br>
and watched a fire truck<br>
barge and shriek its way towards<br>
a certain amount of danger.<br>
</h3>
