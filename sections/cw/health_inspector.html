    <h3>I was busy in the kitchen soaking the morning’s oatmeal bowls when poor Galen came through the front door loud as a plane engine. I couldn’t see him since where I was so I went into the hallway and saw him. He was bent over in half, his hands on his knees. “Galen,” I said, or started saying, but then his stomach let loose and he was spilling his lunch all over the nice wood floor. I shook my head, remembering that I’d just mopped up the day before.
